<h3>Username:<%=' 'html_escaper(@user.username) %></h3>
<h3>Your email:<%=' 'html_escaper(@user.email) %></h3>

<p>This is where we could display stats such as number of questions asked, votes, and comments as well as a number of best answers. Maybe. That'd be later. Also wondering if there's really a point to this profile? Maybe links to your questions? Yeah, that would make sense. Part of the project or something to icebox for when we're done?</p>
